Q1. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other? 

Ans1.  The CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid layout models are both powerful tools for creating complex and responsive layouts in web design. However, they have different use cases and strengths.

Flexbox:

One-dimensional layout: Flexbox is primarily designed for laying out items in a single dimension, either as a row or a column.
Content-first: It's ideal for aligning items within a container, distributing space among them, and controlling their alignment and order.
Responsive design: Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive designs, where items can grow or shrink based on available space.
Simpler layouts: It's great for simpler layouts where you need to align items in a row or column, or when you need to reorder items.
Browser support: Flexbox has good browser support, but older versions of Internet Explorer (IE 10 and below) have limited support.
Grid:

Two-dimensional layout: CSS Grid is designed for creating complex two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns.
Grid lines and cells: It's ideal for aligning items in a grid-like structure, where you can define the size of rows and columns, and place items in specific cells.
Responsive design: CSS Grid is also great for responsive designs, as you can define how items should behave at different screen sizes.
Complex layouts: It's particularly useful for more complex layouts, such as magazine-style designs or multi-column forms.
Browser support: CSS Grid has good browser support, but older versions of Internet Explorer (IE 10 and below) have limited support.

When to choose one over the other:

Flexbox: Use Flexbox when you need to align items in a single dimension (row or column), or when you need to reorder items. It's great for simpler layouts and responsive designs.
Grid: Use CSS Grid when you need to create complex two-dimensional layouts, such as magazine-style designs or multi-column forms. It's also great for responsive designs and has good browser support.
In some cases, you might even use both Flexbox and Grid together, as they can complement each other in creating complex layouts. For example, you might use Flexbox to align items within a grid cell, or use Grid to create a grid layout and then use Flexbox to align items within each grid cell.
